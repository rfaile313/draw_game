### Future features/ideas

1) Money earned from duels
2) Stuff to spend money on 
3) the ability to place wagers on said duels to try and get more cash
4) and maybe between rounds, you give a stat breakdown of your next opponent
5) accuracy based on gun/skill
the money would buy you clothes/items
that increase your stats
but also might decrease other stats
so maybe you have more power or accuracy
but it takes longer for the gun to go off
i like the idea of like slow motion/bullet time/camera shake too

-----> Slow motion is cool.
what if you had a single counter int that was only being incremented by one file, and all the other files read from that counter, but didn't increment it?
